Learn Elixir
=

This repo is intended to be a companion to the book "Programming Elixir". This
iteration is intended specifically for the 1.3 version of the book.

This repo is divided into directories for each chapter, and there are exercises
within those. There may be more than one exercise in a given chapter.

Each exercise is an elixir project of its own. It will have unit tests you are
to make pass. Some tests are tagged `@tag skip: true`. This tag will cause that
particular test to be skipped. Your job as a learner is to un-tag the tests one
by one and make them pass.

In each repo, you can run the tests by executing the command `mix test`.
