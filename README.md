Learn Elixir
=

This repo is intended to be a companion to the book "Programming Elixir".

Some tests are tagged `@tag skip: true`. This tag will cause that
particular test to be skipped. Your job as a learner is to un-tag the tests one
by one and make them pass.

In each repo, you can run the tests by executing the command `mix test`.
